# MicroservicesProject
Microservices APIs for Open Innovation semester. The Microservices will be based on [Bestel.app](https://bestel.app/), which I got permission for from Remco.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Docker Desktop
Visual Studio or similar programs
```

### What in the project?

Every API has their own database, as per design.

- OrdeAPI
- PaymentAPI

**- OrderAPI**

This is where all orders come in, for example if you order a drink and some food.


**- PaymentAPI**

When you pay for your order, this is where the payment will go through.
